# Hair-Classifier
Hair Classification CNN, Knowledge-Based Recommendation System, LIME Implementation

Hair detection is a newly budding area of AI.  It is useful for many applications including digital recognition, surveillance, and hair modeling.  However, there is a much more personalized use for this type of technology: product recommendation.  Though hair type may seem trivial to some, it is certainly not obvious to everyone. Using a Convolutional Neural Network with hand-labeled training data pulled from Figaro (an image database for hair detection), kaggle, and google image searches, we were able to achieve over 90% accuracy classifying images into four hair types: straight, wavy, curly, and tightly coiled. Based on these classifications and further personalized questions about hair needs, we were able to build a product recommender system that can be adapted by any hair care brand.
